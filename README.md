LeaMusic is an app that lets you load and play full songs or individual tracks (stems). It displays the audio as a waveform, making it easy and intuitive to navigate through the music.
You can set loops to repeat specific sections, adjust playback speed and pitch, and zoom in on the waveform for precise control over loop points and the playhead position. You can also place markers to highlight important parts of the track.
LeaMusic lets you save and load your projects locallyâ€”and if you want, you can sync them with Google Drive to keep your work backed up and accessible anywhere.
